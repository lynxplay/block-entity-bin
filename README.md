# **Block Entity Bin**

### A plugin to fix worlds affected by [PaperMC/Paper#10022](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/issues/10022)

> Liberate your server from world-breaking block entities.

## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> Block Entity Bin messes with your world data.
> Take extensive backups of your server, specifically your worlds, before installing it.

1) Grab the latest jar from the project's release page.
2) Move it into your servers `plugins/` directory.
3) Start your server.
4) (Optionally)  
   Block Entity Bin runs when a world is attempted to be loaded.
   If you have custom worlds managed by e.g. Multiverse or you have 
   world loading on start disabled, make sure to load these worlds manually
   for the plugin to process them.
5) Stop your server and remove the plugin from the `plugins/` folder.
6) You are done ðŸŽ‰
